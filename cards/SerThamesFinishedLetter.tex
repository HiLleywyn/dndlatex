            \FlavorText{1}{Dearest Cillian,\\
I need the blade. Send it to Graymoor, but not to my house. I fear I need to work in secrecy, as anyone among us could harbour the curse. Instead, send it by courier to the woods near my house. There’s an oak tree with an owl carved into it’s trunk. Tell them to bury it at it’s foot. Have it delivered on the night of the full moon; any earlier, and my intent may be discovered. By Our Lady’s Grace, Cillian, I had hoped I'd never have use of it.}
