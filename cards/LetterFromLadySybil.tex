            \FlavorText{1}{Hello lovelies! I’ve been interested in you since you started poking around, and I think it’s only fair I make myself known to you, given that it’s likely you would have crossed paths with me later anyhow. The long and the short of it is, I want to help you. I can’t tell you exactly what it is you must do, because frankly, I have no idea. But I can give you this \textbf{key}. Take it to \textbf{Henriette’s library}, and follow the \textbf{map}. You’ll find what you need there. And don’t forget Ser Thames' sword!\\

            Remember, do your best, and if you don’t figure it out by midnight tonight, everyone in Graymoor will die.\\

            Kisses,\\
            Lady Sybil}
