            \FlavorText{1}{Dropped in the woods by a fey on the run. A silver arrowhead that is only active when affixed to a shaft and fired from a bow. This magic weapon is meant to slay a shape\-changer.\\

            If a shape\-changer takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a \textbf{DC 17 Constitution} saving throw, taking an extra \textbf{6d10 piercing damage on a failed save}, or \textbf{half as much extra damage on a successful one}.}
             \BonusText{1}{Uses}{Once this arrow of slaying deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a non-magical silvered arrow.}
